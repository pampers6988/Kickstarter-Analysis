# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
To use Excel formulas and graphs to produce the reqired data and visualizations (charts) for the project
### Purpose
To find the data to analyze in order to show how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
Three charts were produced to visualize the data for two scenarios "outcomes based on goals" and "outcomes based on launch date". 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data shows that 60% were successful, 35% failed, 3% were canceled and 2% were live shows, however there were no launches after March for the live group. It is best to launch in May than any other month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The lower the goal, the higher percentage of success.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No difficulties with the data but the analysis is much more of a challenge. I need to work on data anlysis. I am no statistician so this is my biggest challenge. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Successful and Failed launches were the highest in the same month (May)
Successful and Failed launches ended the year near the same.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The number cancelled is not useful.
Percentage successful and failed is equal with the goal set between 15000-19000
Successful launches were able to meet their goal in a relativly short time period. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is a lot of data in the Kickstarter spreadsheet, maybe pare it down abit to include only the pertinant data

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The number of backers for outcomes based on launch date compared to the goals set.
